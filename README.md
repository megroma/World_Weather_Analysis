# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
We were tasked with collecting travel information to allow customers to search their preferred city and Hotel information based on weather paramenters. We created charts that mapped the relationship between certain weather conditions and the latitude of the location. We also mapped biking directions for four Hotels that met the preferred criteria of a max temperature between 65 and 75 degrees.
